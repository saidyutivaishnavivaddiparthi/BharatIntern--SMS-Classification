 We are going to Develop a text classification model that classifies SMS as either spam or non-spa using data science techniques in Python.
 The notebook (spam_classifier.ipynb)consists steps to process and explore the dataset, convert messages to vectors and applying ML techniques for the same.
 The notebook(spam_classifier_rnn.ipynb) uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and LSTM to classify the messages. RNNs are networks with loops in them, allowing information from previous time step to persist capable of handling long-term dependencies.
The Dataset is a set of SMS tagged messages collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.

The dataset is available https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection
